# DE-HNN Exploration and Re-Implmentation

## Purpose

The DE-HNN paper explores the DigIC dataset and processes with the goal of 
downstream machine learning tasks with its proposed neural network architecture. 
The code here explores the datasets as well as the graph representation used by 
the paper.

## Data

### DigIC Raw Dataset
