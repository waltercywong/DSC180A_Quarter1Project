# MTA_Subway_Graph_Representation

## Purpose

The MTA transit system is an expansive subway system that connects the boroughs 
of New York City. The code in `representation.ipynb` creates a graph 
representation of the subway system and its rider traffic, along with some 
queries that are useful for analysis and solving problems regarding optimizing 
riders' experience.
