# DSC180A Quarter 1 Project

## Introduction

The following contains code for two assignments involving the exploration of graph theory and its applications in chip design. Assignment 1 explores creating a queryable graph representation of the MTA subway system. Assignment 2 explores the DigIC dataset and how it was processed for use in the DE-HNN research paper.

Please see README files of each assignment for more information.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/waltercywong/DSC180A_Quarter1Project
cd DSC180A_Quarter1Project
```

### Step 2: Download Required Files

#### Assignment 1 Files

Download the MTA ridership data at the following Google Drive link:

https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fV47SWGv5_AFPR_gRfvK1ra1LfSFCgOw

Place the downloaded csv file into the `assignment1/data` folder.

#### Assignment 2 Files

Download the processed dataset at the following link:
